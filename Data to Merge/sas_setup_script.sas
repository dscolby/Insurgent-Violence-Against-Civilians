                           JANUARY 1976 VERSION                                 
                                                                                
   The following SAS setup sections may appear in this file for the LRECL       
   version of this data collection.  These sections are listed below:           
                                                                                
   PROC FORMAT, in these statements, creates user-defined labels as             
   formats for variable values.   Formats replace original values with the      
   user-defined labels in subsequent SAS procedures once the formats            
   are assigned to a variable by the FORMAT command in the DATA step.           
   Not all variables necessarily have user-defined formats.                     
                                                                                
   DATA begins a SAS data step and names an output SAS dataset.                 
                                                                                
   INFILE identifies the input file to be read with the input statement.        
   Users must replace the "file-specification" with host computer-specific      
   input file specifications.                                                   
                                                                                
   INPUT contains the SAS statements which assign the variable names and        
   specify the beginning and ending column locations in the LRECL data          
   file for each variable.                                                      
                                                                                
   LABEL assigns variable labels for all variables in the data file.            
   Variable labels and variable names may be identical for some data            
   files.                                                                       
                                                                                
   FORMAT in the SAS data step assigns the formats generated by the             
   PROC FORMAT procedure with the variable values in the SAS system file.       
   When SAS subsequently creates output, it utilizes the labels                 
   found in the FORMAT rather than the raw data values.  NOTE: If a format      
   is assigned to a variable with a FORMAT statement, the values for            
   the variable are categorized by their labels *before* compilation and        
   printing by subsequent SAS procedures, i.e., values with identical           
   formats are treated as one group even though their values are                
   different.  Accordingly, users need to look at variable values before        
   jobs are run to assure that inadvertent grouping of results does not         
   occur.                                                                       
                                                                                
   MISSING VALUE RECODE sets user-defined numeric missing values to             
   missing as interpreted by the SAS system.  Only variables with               
   user-defined missing values are included in these statements.                
                                                                                
   Users may combine and modify these sections or parts of these sections       
   to suit their specific needs.  Users will also need to change the            
   file-specification in the INFILE statement to an appropriate filename        
   for their system.  Please note that the PROC FORMAT, FORMAT and              
   MISSING VALUE RECODE sections have been commented out (i.e., '/*').          
   To include the PROC FORMAT, FORMAT and MISSING VALUE RECODE sections         
   in the final SAS setup, remove the comment indicators from those             
   sections.
